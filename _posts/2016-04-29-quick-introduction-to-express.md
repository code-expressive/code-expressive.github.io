# Prerequisite: Install Node + npm

Ensure Node and npm are installed. You can download and install them both from [here](nodejs.org) and run the following:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers. If there are errors, the installation likely failed, or the PATH variable must be updated.

# Getting Express

Create a new folder as your base directory. Run `npm init` , then run

```
npm install express --save
```
